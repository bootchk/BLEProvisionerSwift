/*
 logic of application/business
 
 This chains business events together.
 The chain is:
 - user start action (push button)
 - discover device, 
 - connect
 - discover service
 - discover characteristic
 - write characteristic
 - (written device expected to disconnect itself)
 - wait for disconnect
 - enable action again (ready to repeat)
 With no delays
 
 TODO the value written is a "mark" of sync
 i.e. elapsed time from user button pushed to time of write to characteristic
 */

    Record time of button press, later calculate delta and write it to characteristic.
